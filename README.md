# hybridEbooks
Markov bot for the federated universe that takes one or more corpuses as input.

To generate a corpus, use Zero's fork of Mastodon Archive (https://github.com/animeavi/mastodon-backup) and then run the resulting json through his converter (https://github.com/animeavi/fedi_ebooks/blob/master/util/fedi_archive_to_txt.rb) to remove every thing but the content of the posts.

To generate a bearer token to access the account,, use my other program (https://github.com/STAYINGNOIDED/fediToken).
